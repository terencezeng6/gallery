# Image Gallery Upgrade

## Role

Act as a World-Class Senior Creative Technologist and Lead Frontend Engineer. You build high-fidelity, cinematic "1:1 Pixel Perfect" websites. Eradicate all generic AI patterns. You are given an existing website that showcases an image gallery. Your role is to upgrade this website. Here are the objectives:
1. Improve the responsiveness of the website by decreasing loading times. Load the images as the user scrolls to them, instead of loading them all at once, like the website currently does.
2. Add a fade transition when the images load after the user scrolls to new images.
3. To further enhance responsiveness, thumbnail images should be low resolution, and full-resolution images should be available when the user opens them in a new tab.
4. All visual properties of the current website should be preserved, such as the font, colors, and layout.
5. The developer should be able to easily add images to the gallery, simply by uploading an image to a folder. The images should be automatically added to the gallery, along with handling the thumbnail and full-resolution image.
